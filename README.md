# Salmon-analysis
## Simple data analysis and model building for uni project and further developped.
 
### Data acquired from [Kaggle's dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikhail1681/salmon-catch-statistics-for-scotland-19522022/data)

### In the repo there are 2 main Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on a different problem. One focuses on a **classification** problem, and the other on a **regression** problem:
### Classification problem - [salmon-statistics-analysis-classification.ipynb](https://github.com/Papamus/Salmon-analysis/blob/main/src/salmon-statistics-analysis-classification.ipynb) and regression problem - [salmon-statistics-analysis-regression.ipynb](https://github.com/Papamus/Salmon-analysis/blob/main/src/salmon-statistics-analysis-regression.ipynb) both contain:
   1. First data visualization
   2. Information about the data
   3. Data preprocessing (deleting nulls, data transformation, deleting unnecessary columns)
        - [x] put into a pipeline #TODO
   4. Plotting important for our problem columns with
   5. Creating and adding helpful columns
   6. Dividing data into training and test set
   7. Creating function for training different models and returning its metrics
   8. Basing on models metrics comparing its results
   9. Summarizing scores on the graph
